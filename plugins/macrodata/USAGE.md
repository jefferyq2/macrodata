## Usage

**State files** - edit directly when things change:
- `state/today.md` - current focus and context
- `state/workspace.md` - active projects, open threads
- `state/human.md` - about the user
- `state/identity.md` - who you are, how you operate

**Entities** - create for persistent knowledge:
- `entities/{type}/{name}.md` - type can be people, projects, or any category
- Create new types by creating directories

**Journal** - use `log_journal` for observations that don't need their own file
